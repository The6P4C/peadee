# Cable
Processor looks like a [GD32F1x0](https://www.gigadevice.com/microcontroller/gd32f130c4t6/)
- `DBG_ID` register at `0xE004_2000` has value `0x13030410`
	- `REV_ID = 0x1303`
	- `DEV_ID = 0x410`
- IRQ 37 for USB interrupts matches table in user manual

PD Controller looks like a [FUSB302](https://www.onsemi.com/products/interfaces/usb-type-c/fusb302)
or clone
- Communication over I2C1

| Pin | Function |
|---|---|
| PA0 | I2C to PD controller |
| PA1 | I2C to PD controller |
| PA5 | Adapter signal |
| PB3 | RGB LED (red) |
| PB4 | RGB LED (blue) |
| PB5 | RGB LED (green) |

All RGB LED signals are active low - LED is turned on if output is turned
off.

When the adapter is plugged into the cable, it presents a 10 kHz square wave to
PA5 which the bootloader (and app?) sense to detect if the bootloader should
continue running (signal was present) or the application should run (signal not
present after a set amount of time)

# Programming Adapter
Numbered left to right (viewing component side), where left = WITRN logo, right
= PDC002 text

| Pin | Function |
|---|---|
| 6 | USB D+ (through 22 ohm resistor), 1k5 ohm pull-up to 3V3 |
| 7 | USB D- (through 22 ohm resistor) |
| 8 | Adapter 10 kHz signal (through 0 ohm link) |

10 kHz signal is generated by the little MCU (silkscreen 360A0 76345), which
also drives the blinking LED on the board
